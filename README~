==================================
Usage
--------------------------
data generator

Generate various data in order to facilitate experimenting and testing robots.
It can insert different data into Redis in our lab with specified keys.
You can change the host and port of Redis, frame rate of setting, key and value of your own data.
If wanting random data or clear existing data, you can use the codes listed in the webpage. Simply copy and paste them into the value zone of your key, and press submit.
----------------
data parser

Old version of the data parser based on C++ and GNUPlot.
Useless except someone loves GNUPlot.
----------------
static plot

Draw a static plot of data from Redis.
If you organize your data into a string separated with space, and set into Redis, you can plot that with this page by simply input the key and press submit.
----------------
a simple dynamic plot

Really simple. Not effective.
----------------
dynamic plot for all robots

Dynamic plots and trajectories of robots with data retrieved from Redis.
I suppose the names of robots as "cb18", "cb01", and "pioneer01", and the key of the data from Redis is the name. I think I should make it configurable later on.
The format of the data is "time x y voltage current".
If you use "data generator" (the first link in the front page), put "cb18" (without quotation mark) as key, and "@@@random_robot" (without quotation mark) as value, you can see the figure and trajectory is moving.
----------------
dynamic plot for one robot

Similar with previous, but the data are not from Redis.
So you can use the previous one instead.
----------------
trajectory plot

Two different versions of trajectory plots with data retrieved from Redis.
The format of data is the same with the one for "dynamic plot for all robots", but it only works for one robot (the first one in the data stream).
---------------
google map

Trajectory plots on google map with data retrieved from Redis.
You can see energy map, time map, and colorful trajectory representing inner state of the robot. You can follow any of the robots. If you click on a grid in energy map or time map, you can see the data for that grid.
The data for each robot is from Redis. The key is the name of the robot (only cb18, cb01, pi01 available). The value follows the format "time x y voltage current" (without quotation mark).
If you use "data generator" (the first link in the front page), put "cb18" (without quotation mark) as key, and "@@@field_robot" (without quotation mark, note not @@@random_robot) as value, you can see the trajectory on the google map is moving.

The website is still under construction. If you find bugs, or feel hard to understand the description with my poor English, please contact me [fzhan at sfu dot ca]. I apologize for any inconvience.
